# Contribution Guidelines

## Branching

- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- All work must be done on a separate branch based on `dev`.
- Use the following naming conventions:
  - feature/<short-description> for new features
  - fix/<short-description> for bug fixes
  - chore/<short-description> for non-functional changes (e.g. configs, documentation)

## Pull Requests

- All pull requests must target `dev`.
- All pull requests require at least 1 approval before merging.
- All conversations must be resolved before merging.
- Squash or rebase merge only. Do not use merge commits.

## Code Quality

- Code must pass automated checks (tests, linters).
- Ensure commits follow project standards.
