    Implemented Features

        1. Tailwind CSS v3 Integration
        Successfully set up and configured Tailwind CSS v3.

        Verified functionality with sample utility classes (bg-green-100, text-cyan-400, etc.).

        Configuration file tailwind.config.js is customized for future scalability.

        2. Dark/Light Mode Toggle
        Implemented a toggle button in the Header.jsx using lucide-react icons.

        Stored theme preference in localStorage for persistence across sessions.

        Theme preference also respects user system preference on first load.

        Applied conditional dark class to document.documentElement and styled accordingly with Tailwind.

        3. Responsive Header with Burger Menu
        Created a sticky Header component with logo (<Shield />) and navigation links.

        Developed a mobile-friendly burger menu with toggle animation.

        Navigation is hidden on md and displayed with flex for larger viewports.

        4. Modern UI Layout (Grid System)
        Used responsive Tailwind grid layout (grid-cols-1, sm:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3) to display cards dynamically.

        Spacing and padding handled with gap-6, mt-20, and container mx-auto p-4.

        5. Dynamic Content Fetching
        Used useEffect to fetch articles from /api/reports.

        Implemented loading, error, and empty-state UI feedback.

        Displayed total article count at the bottom.

        6. Stylized Article Cards
        Created ReportCard.jsx with:

        Title, summary, date, and tag display.

        Line clamp utility for text overflow.

        Border glow and hover transition effects for modern aesthetics.

        Icons used to represent categories like AI, Ransomware, Network Security.

        7. Design System
        Color palette: Deep navy backgrounds (#0a0f1a), electric blue highlights, white text.

        Typography: Clean sans-serif fonts with hierarchy.

        Accessibility: Toggle buttons have aria-labels.

        Visual effects: Shadows, glows, and hover transitions using Tailwind.


    Testing & Validation

        Verified dark mode toggle persists on reload.

        Ensured responsiveness across breakpoints (sm, md, lg).

        Confirmed cards render correctly with different data sizes.

    Dependencies Used

        tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer

        lucide-react for icons

        classnames (optional) for conditional class handling


    Suggestions for Next Features

        Hero section with glowing shield graphic and subheading.

        Filtering or search bar for articles.

        Backend tagging system to categorize data (NEWS, REPORTS, ANALYSIS).

        Loading skeletons instead of plain text loader.


   ** Update => 27/07/2025

        Report Card Restructuring

            Modified the structure so that the card has two columns at the top:

            Column 1: article icon.
            Column 2: date at the top and title at the bottom.
            At the bottom, the card has two sections:
            Left column: article summary.
            Right column: AI analysis button.
            Improved visual and semantic layout using flexbox and grid to clearly separate the sections.

        Hero.jsx update

            A new main tagline has been added below the title:
            "We empower digital defenders with timely cyber threat intelligence and AI-driven insights."
            The terminal-like animation, icon, and responsive design have been maintained.
