Step 2: Understanding the Code

    Imports required libraries

        Flask to create a web server

        CORS to allow frontend requests

        database.py, llm_tools.py, and scraper.py for helper functions

    init_db() runs at startup

        This ensures that the database is ready when the app starts

    /api/news Route

        Calls fetch_latest_articles() to get cybersecurity news

        Passes each article to analyze_article() (LLM for insights)

        Saves the report in the database

        Returns all reports as JSON

    /api/reports Route

        Retrieves and returns stored reports from the database
