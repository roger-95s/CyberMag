# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the Cybersecurity AI-Powered Magazine Web App project. To ensure code quality, maintainability, and a smooth development process, please follow these guidelines.

## Branching Model

- **Do not commit directly to `main` or `dev`.**
- All work must be done in a feature branch created from `dev`.
- Use these naming conventions:
  - `feature/<short-description>` for new features (e.g., `feature/article-scraper`)
  - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-error`)
  - `chore/<short-description>` for maintenance and non-functional changes (e.g., `chore/update-docs`)

## Pull Requests

- All pull requests must target `dev`.
- Each pull request must:
  - Have a clear and descriptive title.
  - Include a summary of changes and the reason for the change.
  - Link to any related issues or tasks.
  - Pass all automated checks (tests, linters, etc.).
  - Be reviewed and approved by at least one code reviewer.
  - Resolve all conversations and requested changes before merging.

## Merging

- Only squash or rebase merges are allowed.
- Do not use merge commits.
- Do not merge your own pull requests unless you are the designated reviewer for that area (see CODEOWNERS).

## Code Quality

- Backend code (Flask / Python) must pass:
  - `flake8` for style/linting.
  - All `pytest` unit tests.

- Frontend code (React / JavaScript) must pass:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`

## Commit Standards

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Example format: `fix(api): handle 500 error for login`
- Use small, focused commits where possible.

## Additional Notes

- If in doubt, ask for clarification in your pull request or via team communication channels.
- This project uses branch protection rules. Direct pushes to protected branches will be rejected by GitHub.
